4️⃣ Python Operator Precedence Cheat Sheet (High → Low)
()                      Parentheses
**                      Exponentiation
+x  -x  ~x              Unary operators
*  /  //  %             Multiplication, Division
+  -                    Addition, Subtraction
<<  >>                  Bitwise shift
&                       Bitwise AND
^                       Bitwise XOR
|                       Bitwise OR
==  !=  >  <  >=  <=    Comparisons
is  is not              Identity
in  not in               Membership
not                     Logical NOT
and                     Logical AND
or                      Logical OR

5️⃣ Associativity Cheat Sheet
Operator	Associativity
**	Right to Left
=	Right to Left
All others	Left to Right
6️⃣ Important Mixed Examples
Arithmetic
print(10 + 20 * 3)     # 70
print((10 + 20) * 3)   # 90

Logical Operators
print(True or False and False)


Output: True

Why?
and has higher precedence than or

→ True or (False and False)
→ True or False → True

Comparison + Logical
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10)


Output: True

Membership + Logical
print(3 in [1,2,3] and 5 > 2)


Output: True
